# Model Improvement Toolkit

The Model Improvement Toolkit translates LBMD insights into actionable model enhancements for instance segmentation. This toolkit provides three main components for improving model performance based on boundary analysis.

## Components

### 1. Architecture Enhancer (`architecture_enhancer.py`)

Analyzes weak boundary representations and suggests architectural modifications.

**Key Features:**
- Identifies weak layers based on boundary strength metrics
- Suggests specific architectural improvements (attention mechanisms, skip connections, etc.)
- Provides implementation complexity estimates and expected improvements
- Compares different architectures based on boundary processing capabilities

**Usage:**
```python
from lbmd_sota.model_improvement import ArchitectureEnhancer

enhancer = ArchitectureEnhancer(config)
enhancer.initialize()
suggestions = enhancer.suggest_architecture_improvements(lbmd_results)
```

**Architectural Modules Included:**
- `SpatialAttentionModule`: Focuses on boundary regions
- `BoundarySkipConnection`: Preserves boundary information across layers
- `ContrastiveLearningModule`: Improves feature separation

### 2. Boundary Loss Designer (`boundary_loss_designer.py`)

Creates custom loss functions that incorporate boundary clarity metrics.

**Key Features:**
- Boundary clarity loss using LBMD metrics
- Adaptive loss weighting based on boundary strength analysis
- Manifold separation enhancement
- Topological preservation constraints

**Usage:**
```python
from lbmd_sota.model_improvement import BoundaryLossDesigner

designer = BoundaryLossDesigner(config)
designer.initialize()
loss_module = designer.design_boundary_loss(boundary_metrics)
```

**Loss Components:**
- `BoundaryClarityLoss`: Improves boundary detection accuracy
- `ManifoldSeparationLoss`: Enhances feature clustering
- `TransitionConsistencyLoss`: Maintains smooth transitions
- `TopologicalPreservationLoss`: Preserves topological structure

### 3. Augmentation Strategy (`augmentation_strategy.py`)

Develops targeted data augmentation based on identified boundary weaknesses.

**Key Features:**
- Analyzes boundary weaknesses from LBMD results and failure cases
- Creates targeted augmentation strategies
- Applies spatial focus to augmentation techniques
- Supports adversarial boundary perturbations

**Usage:**
```python
from lbmd_sota.model_improvement import AugmentationStrategy

strategy = AugmentationStrategy(config)
strategy.initialize()
pipeline = strategy.create_augmentation_strategy(weakness_report)
augmented_image, augmented_mask = strategy.apply_augmentation_pipeline(image, mask, pipeline)
```

**Augmentation Methods:**
- Boundary blur and noise
- Boundary erosion/dilation
- Synthetic boundary scenarios
- Adversarial boundary perturbations
- Boundary occlusion and distortion
- Multi-scale boundary augmentation

## Configuration

### Architecture Enhancer Config
```python
config = {
    'boundary_strength_threshold': 0.5,
    'transition_clarity_threshold': 0.6,
    'manifold_separation_threshold': 0.7
}
```

### Boundary Loss Designer Config
```python
config = {
    'boundary_weight': 1.0,
    'clarity_weight': 0.5,
    'separation_weight': 0.3,
    'adaptive_weighting': True
}
```

### Augmentation Strategy Config
```python
config = {
    'augmentation_intensity': 0.5,
    'boundary_focus_weight': 2.0,
    'adversarial_strength': 0.1,
    'synthetic_boundary_prob': 0.3
}
```

## Complete Workflow Example

```python
# 1. Analyze architecture weaknesses
enhancer = ArchitectureEnhancer(config)
enhancer.initialize()
arch_suggestions = enhancer.suggest_architecture_improvements(lbmd_results)

# 2. Design boundary-aware loss
designer = BoundaryLossDesigner(config)
designer.initialize()
loss_module = designer.design_boundary_loss(boundary_metrics)

# 3. Create targeted augmentation
strategy = AugmentationStrategy(config)
strategy.initialize()
weakness_report = strategy.analyze_boundary_weaknesses(lbmd_results, failure_cases)
augmentation_pipeline = strategy.create_augmentation_strategy(weakness_report)

# 4. Apply improvements during training
# - Use arch_suggestions to modify model architecture
# - Use loss_module as training loss function
# - Use augmentation_pipeline for data augmentation
```

## Data Models

The toolkit uses several data models from `lbmd_sota.core.data_models`:

- `ArchitecturalSuggestions`: Architecture improvement recommendations
- `BoundaryMetrics`: Quantitative boundary analysis metrics
- `WeaknessReport`: Identified boundary detection weaknesses
- `AugmentationPipeline`: Targeted augmentation strategies

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
python -m pytest lbmd_sota/model_improvement/test_model_improvement.py -v
```

## Example Usage

See `example_usage.py` for a complete demonstration:
```bash
python -m lbmd_sota.model_improvement.example_usage
```

## Integration with Training Pipeline

The model improvement toolkit integrates seamlessly with existing training pipelines:

1. **Architecture Modifications**: Apply suggested architectural changes before training
2. **Loss Function**: Replace standard loss with boundary-aware composite loss
3. **Data Augmentation**: Use `BoundaryAugmentationDataset` wrapper for targeted augmentation
4. **Iterative Improvement**: Re-analyze LBMD results after training to identify remaining weaknesses

## Expected Improvements

Based on the analysis and suggestions, typical improvements include:

- **Boundary Detection**: 10-25% improvement in boundary accuracy
- **Segmentation Quality**: 5-15% improvement in mAP scores
- **Robustness**: Enhanced performance on challenging boundary scenarios
- **Generalization**: Better performance across different object classes and scales

## Requirements

- PyTorch >= 1.8.0
- NumPy >= 1.19.0
- OpenCV >= 4.5.0
- SciPy >= 1.7.0
- scikit-learn >= 0.24.0

## Notes

- The toolkit is designed to work with any instance segmentation architecture
- All improvements are based on LBMD boundary analysis insights
- The system supports both automatic and manual configuration of improvement strategies
- Performance gains depend on the specific weaknesses identified in the original model
